# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## main concept
In this analysis we preprocessed th data and use a neural networks to build a model to create a system to easily determine which orginizations used the money most effectively.

## Results
The target variable is succesful since that is the outcome we're trying to predict.
The variables that should be removed from the input data are EIN and NAME because these are is no beneficial data in those columns.

## Model Proformance 
The model was able to correctly predict an organization's success rate of 72.6%. This is close to but below the target model performance of 75%.

# Summary
Attempting to optimize the out put percent did not significantly increase the success rate. Only minimul 10THs of percent.
